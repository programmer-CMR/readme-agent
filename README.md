## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not miracles.
It amplifies existing human tendencies; good and bad.
Progress demands constant questioning, not blind acceptance.
Faster isn't always better; consider the downstream effects.
Implementation is the key; ideas alone solve nothing.
- Anya Sharma"
