## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not magic.
It amplifies existing problems just as easily as it solves them.
Before celebrating progress, understand the full impact.
Who benefits? Who loses? What gets left behind?
Don't blindly follow the shiny object; demand accountability.
- Elias Thorne"
