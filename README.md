## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad, it's just a tool.
It amplifies what's already there in human nature.
If you're lazy, it will make you incredibly lazy.
If you're kind, it gives you the power to help millions.
Use it wisely, because the consequences are real.

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
