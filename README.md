## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "New tech solves old problems, sure. But it always creates new ones, usually harder to predict. Don't believe the hype that this app or gadget is a cure-all. Constant upgrades mean constant learning, and constant adaptation. And always ask who benefits, and who is left behind, when progress marches on."
- John Michael Prescott"
