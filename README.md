## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's a tool.
It amplifies what's already there, good or bad.
Faster doesn't equal better if you're heading in the wrong direction.
Focus on solving real problems, not just creating new gadgets.
Ultimately, progress is defined by how we treat each other, not what we invent.
- Amelia Earhart"
