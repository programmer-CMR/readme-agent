## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology gives us tools. That's it.
Better tools don't automatically make better choices.
Faster progress demands smarter questions, not just faster answers.
Don't mistake new possibilities for inevitable improvements.
Always ask who benefits, and at what cost.

- Evelyn Reed"
