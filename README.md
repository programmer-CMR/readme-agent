## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is always a double-edged sword.
It can lift us to unimaginable heights, or trap us in deeper holes.
Choose wisely what problems you task it to solve.
Efficiency without purpose is just a faster road to nowhere.
Understand the cost, not just the convenience.

- Eleanor Vance"
