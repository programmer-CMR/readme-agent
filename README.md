## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not magic.
Each upgrade demands a sacrifice, be it time, skills, or obsolete equipment.
Progress isn't linear, expect bumps and setbacks, often expensive ones.
Focus on what you can *do* with the tool, not just the tool itself.
The real innovation is in adapting, not simply adopting.
- Elias Thorne"
