## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad.
It amplifies what's already there: greed, kindness, efficiency.
Focus on the input. Build systems for the common good.
Otherwise, progress is just a faster road to the same ditch.
And that ditch is often deeper than we imagine.

- Elias Thorne"
