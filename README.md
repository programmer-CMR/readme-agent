## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's a tool.
A faster way to do things, not a replacement for thought.
If your systems fail, know how to work without them.
Progress means building things that actually last, not just look good.
Focus on fixing the problems, not just buying the latest update.
- Ada Lovelace Jr."
