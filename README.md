## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's a tool.
Tools need purpose, not just existence.
Faster and cheaper means nothing if it's pointed in the wrong direction.
Focus on the 'why' before worrying about the 'how' many times you can do it per second.
Otherwise, you're just accelerating toward a brick wall.

- Evelyn Reed"
