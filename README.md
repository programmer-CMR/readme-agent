## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is ease, but it only delivers efficiency.
That efficiency demands constant upgrades and new learning.
If you're not learning, you're becoming obsolete.
Don't confuse convenience with control. Know the tradeoff.
Progress isn't inevitable; it's a choice.
- Evelyn Reed"
