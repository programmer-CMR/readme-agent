## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technologyâ€™s relentless march forward doesnâ€™t guarantee a better world.
It just gives you faster ways to mess things up.
Progress isnâ€™t about inventing the next shiny thing.
It's about figuring out what problems are worth solving
and using these tools responsibly.

- Eleanor Vance"
