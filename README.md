## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; people using technology do. New tools just amplify existing abilities. If your foundation is weak, the fancy software only makes the collapse faster and more spectacular. Focus on fundamentals first, then pick the right machine to help. Don't let the gadgets drive you, you drive them.

- Elias Vance"
