## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology gives us new tools, not new brains.
Better tools can build bigger, but bigger doesn't always mean better.
Always ask: What problem does this *actually* solve?
Progress isn't just faster, it's smarter. Think before you build.
If it creates more problems than it solves, it's not progress, it's just noise.
- Eleanor Vance"
