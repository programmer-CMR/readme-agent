## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers a shortcut, not a solution.
It amplifies what already exists: good intentions or bad.
Progress isn't automatic, it demands critical thinking, always.
Don't confuse complexity with advancement; usefulness wins.
Remember, the tool shapes the user as much as the user shapes the tool.
- Elara Vance"
