## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems on its own.
It's a tool. A fast one, sure, but still a tool.
If you aim it wrong, it just amplifies the mess.
Think about the consequences before you hit "go."
Or you’ll be cleaning up someone else's disaster, including your own.

- Amelia Hernandez"
