## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "New tech solves problems, but creates new ones too.
Think about those consequences before you automate everything.
Increased efficiency isn't the only measurement of success.
Real progress means leaving fewer people behind, not more.
And remember, the power button cuts both ways; it can turn on, or shut it all down."
- Anya Sharma"
