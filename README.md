## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but it demands vigilance.

Don't automate a broken system; you'll just break it faster.

Progress without purpose is just sophisticated chaos.

Always ask: Who benefits, and at what cost?

The best tech solves real problems, not manufactured desires.

- Elias Thorne"
