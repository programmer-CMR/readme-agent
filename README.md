## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones.

Don't assume progress is always forward. It's often sideways, or backwards, in disguise.

Focus on the human cost. Every efficiency gain comes from somewhere.

Question everything new. Especially the promises of utopia.

Ultimately, technology is a tool. What you build with it reflects who you are.

- Evelyn Reed"
