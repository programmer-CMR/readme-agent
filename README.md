## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises a better life, but delivers different choices.
New tools amplify existing tendencies; good or bad.
Progress isn't automatic; it demands constant evaluation.
Focus on the problems technology solves, not the technology itself.
Ultimately, technology is a tool, and we decide what to build.
- Evelyn Reed"
