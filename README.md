> "Here's a quote:

Technology's only as good as what you *do* with it. Fancy gadgets don't solve problems.
People solving problems, using the gadgets? That's progress.
Don't confuse innovation with improvement.
Ask if it *helps* anyone, beyond lining someone's pockets.
If it doesn't make life easier, safer, or fairer, it’s just noise.

- Marcus Thorne"
