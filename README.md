## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promised shortcuts, but delivered detours. Every tool solves one problem, creating three more. Efficiency gains are eaten by complexity. The speed of progress only reveals how far we still have to go. Remember the human cost before celebrating the machine's victory.

- Anya Sharma"
