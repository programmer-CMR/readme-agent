## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's value isn't in what it *can* do, but what it *actually* gets done. New tools alone don't fix old problems. They just provide new ways to make the same mistakes, faster. Progress requires clear goals, responsible use, and constant evaluation of real-world impact. Don't be blinded by the shiny; focus on the tangible results. Otherwise, you're just building a digital sandcastle.

- Elias Vance"
