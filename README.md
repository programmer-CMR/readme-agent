## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises a faster future, but faster isn't always better.

Consider the consequences of increased speed and efficiency.

Does it truly improve life, or just accelerate its problems?

If the answer is unclear, proceed with caution and critical thought.

Progress should serve humanity, not the other way around.
- Evelyn Reed, Applied Ethics Professor"
