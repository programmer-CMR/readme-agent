## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances. It doesn't inherently make things better.
It just makes them faster, wider, and potentially more destructive.
Focus on what problems you're actually solving before you build another gadget.
Remember the original goal and use the new tool responsibly.
Progress without purpose is just a bigger mess.

- Eleanor Vance"
