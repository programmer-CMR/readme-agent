## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, not necessarily solutions. Before deploying it, identify the core problem it's supposed to solve and have metrics to measure success objectively. If it adds complexity without demonstrable improvement, it's a distraction, not progress. Don't confuse novelty with value; always prioritize practical application. Real progress is measured by tangible benefits, not just lines of code.
- Janet Davies"
