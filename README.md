## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances offer solutions, but introduce new problems. Focus on fixing the real issues, not just adopting the latest trend. Question the long-term impact. Repair before you replace if possible. Consider the human cost before you celebrate any breakthrough.

- Elara Vonn, Systems Engineer"
