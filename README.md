## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad; it's a tool.
The real danger comes when its creators forget
the human element and prioritize speed or profit above all else.
Constant innovation without ethical consideration
is simply a race toward an unpredictable cliff.
- Eleanor Vance"
