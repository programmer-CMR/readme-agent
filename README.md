## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, but delivers choices. More choices mean more decisions. More decisions mean more opportunities for failure. Focus on fixing the problems, not just building the new thing. Constant innovation without a clear purpose is just expensive chaos.

- Elias Vance"
