## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, it doesn't erase them. It often just creates new ones, sometimes bigger.
Understand the limitations of the tool before you celebrate the advance. Progress isnâ€™t linear; itâ€™s a messy cycle.
Never trust a black box you can't open. Especially if itâ€™s running your life.

- Elias Vance"
