## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't fix broken systems. It amplifies them.
If your process was bad before automation, it'll be disastrously bad after.
Progress isn't just shiny new gadgets. Itâ€™s making life better for everyone, actually better.
Check if the benefits are shared, not just hoarded by a few.
Otherwise, you're not moving forward, just circling the drain faster.
- Eleanor Vance"
