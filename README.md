## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a magic wand. It amplifies what we already are.
If we use it for profit alone, society suffers.
Progress isn't automatic; it demands careful consideration.
Question every new platform, every algorithm, every automation.
Always ask: who benefits, and at what cost?
- Anya Sharma"
