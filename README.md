## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is always double-edged.
Faster isn't always better if it sacrifices quality.
Progress without purpose just creates more waste.
Don't be blinded by the newest shiny gadget, think about its impact.
Ask who benefits, and who pays the price, before you adopt it.

- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
