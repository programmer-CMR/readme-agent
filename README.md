## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances, but that doesn't automatically fix everything.
New tools amplify existing tendencies, both good and bad.
Focus on the problem you are trying to solve, not the gadget itself.
Consider the human impact before you deploy.
Progress without purpose is just a faster route to nowhere.
- Evelyn Reed"
