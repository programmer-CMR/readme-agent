## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool. It amplifies what's already there.

If you're building something useful, technology can make it faster and bigger.

If you're building something destructive, it will do the same.

Don't assume progress is inherently good. Question everything's purpose.

The technology itself isn't the answer, it's just the accelerator.

- Ada Lovelace, Systems Analyst"
