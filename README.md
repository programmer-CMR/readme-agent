## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not miracles.
It amplifies existing abilities, both good and bad.
If you lack a strategy, tech just gets you to failure faster.
Don't confuse faster processing with better thinking.
And remember: data is input, wisdom is output.
- Amelia Hernandez, Systems Engineer"
