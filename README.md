## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology changes. It's a tool, not a magic wand.
Use it wisely to fix problems, not create new ones.
Consider the long-term effects before jumping on the bandwagon.
Increased efficiency doesn't equal improved lives automatically.
Think before you automate.

- Dr. Anya Sharma, Efficiency Consultant"
