## 📅 Daily Quote

> "New tech solves problems, but it also creates new ones.
Ignoring that fact is lazy planning.
Focus on the second-order effects, the unexpected consequences.
If your 'progress' doesn't consider those, it will fail.
The best tech isn’t just shiny; it's sustainable for everyone."
- Janice Riley"
