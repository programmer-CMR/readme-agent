## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's just a tool.
Better tools let you dig faster, build higher, and connect further.
But tools require maintenance, training, and understanding.
Ignoring the risks and responsibilities makes progress a liability.
So, focus on the "how" and "why" before the "what" can be done.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Engineer"
