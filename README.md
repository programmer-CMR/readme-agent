## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems, it just changes them.

Think about the long-term consequences, not just the immediate benefits.

Faster doesn't always mean better, and easier can lead to laziness.

Real progress is about improving lives, not just launching new gadgets.

Use technology wisely, or it will use you.

- Evelyn Reed"
