## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but always creates new ones.
Don't get blinded by the shiny object.
Focus on if it truly improves lives, not just changes them.
Consider the long-term costs, not just the immediate gains.
Progress is about bettering humanity, not just advancing capability.
- Evelyn Reed"
