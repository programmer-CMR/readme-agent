## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones. Don't get blinded by the shiny object.
Think about the long-term impact before deploying something at scale.
Will it empower people, or simply replace them?
Is it truly making lives better, or just more efficient?
Efficiency without ethics is a dangerous game.
- Anya Sharma"
