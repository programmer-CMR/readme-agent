## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is efficiency, but reality adds complexity.
New tools amplify existing skills, they don't replace the need for them.
Consider the long-term impact before chasing the immediate gain.
Implementation is key. A perfect design collecting dust serves no one.
Focus less on "what can we do?" and more on "what should we do?"

- Evelyn Reed"
