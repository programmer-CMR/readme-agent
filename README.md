## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't fix broken systems, it amplifies them.
If your processes are bad, faster bad processes equal bigger problems.
Innovation isn't just about doing new things, it's about doing things *better*.
Before you automate anything, understand *why* you're doing it manually now.
Progress without purpose is just a faster route to nowhere.

- Elias Thorne"
