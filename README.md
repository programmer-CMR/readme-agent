## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't neutral. It's a tool.

Tools can build or destroy, depending on who holds them.

Faster doesn't always mean better; think it through first.

Progress only matters if it improves real lives, for everyone.

Question everything, especially shiny new gadgets."
- Maria Sanchez"
