## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should be a tool, not a master.
Focus on what problems it solves, not how shiny it is.
Before implementing something new, ask: does this actually improve lives?
Otherwise, you're just making things more complicated for no good reason.
Progress only matters if it makes the world a better place to live in for everyone.

- Evelyn Reed"
