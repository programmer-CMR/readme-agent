## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's advance isn't inherently good. It's a tool. A hammer can build a house or smash a skull.
The problem isn't the tool itself, but the intent and the control.
Who decides what gets built, and who benefits from the new creation?
These are the questions that truly determine whether progress actually progresses us.
Blind faith in innovation is just ignorance disguised as optimism.

- Eleanor Vance"
