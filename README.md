## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is only as good as its delivery.
Building faster and smarter doesn't solve problems
if we don't fix the inequalities they amplify.
Progress isn't inevitable; it demands constant vigilance.
We must ask ourselves: who benefits, and who is left behind?

- Anya Sharma"
