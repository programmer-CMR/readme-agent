## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't fix problems. It magnifies what's already there.
If you build a tool to connect, are you connecting or isolating?
Progress isn't just faster or shinier. It's about solving real needs.
Always ask, who benefits? And who pays the price for this convenience?
Don't let the new toy distract you from the important work that needs doing.

- Eleanor Vance"
