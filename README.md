## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises shortcuts, but shortcuts can pave the way to dead ends.
Always ask: Who benefits? Who is left behind?
Progress without purpose is just running faster in the wrong direction.
Mastering the tool isn't the same as understanding the task.
Innovation should solve real problems, not create new ones we can't afford.

- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
