## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones. Expect it.
Planning for those consequences is not optional.
Ignoring them leads to more trouble than the original problem.
Always ask: What could go wrong? And who will be affected?
Progress is not inherently good; only thoughtful progress is.
- Eleanor Vance"
