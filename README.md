## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but demands constant attention.
It will solve problems you didn't know you had, and create others entirely new.
Remember that tools are defined by their use, not their potential.
Progress isn't a straight line upward, expect setbacks and unexpected detours.
Ultimately, technology should serve humanity, not the other way around."
- Amelia Hernandez"
