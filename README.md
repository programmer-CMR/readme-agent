## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote, keeping your instructions in mind:

"New tech solves problems, but creates new ones you never considered. Before you implement the shiny system, map out how it breaks. Assume it *will* break. Plan for the worst case: data loss, system failures, and the human cost of retraining. Progress isn't free. Someone always pays the price for 'innovation'."
- Anya Sharma"
