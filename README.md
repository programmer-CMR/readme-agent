## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates them. Don't assume advancement equals improvement. Consider the whole system: resources, people, environment. Ask, "Who benefits?" not just "Can it be done?". Failure to do this guarantees short-term gain and long-term regret.
- Dr. Anya Sharma, Systems Engineer"
