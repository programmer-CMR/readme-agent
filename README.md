## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology simplifies some things, but always complicates others. Don't assume progress is a straight line upwards. It's more like a tangled vine, needing constant pruning. Always ask, “Who benefits?” and “Who pays the price?” when faced with something new. If you only focus on the shiny surface, you'll miss the rot underneath.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
