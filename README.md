## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems; it amplifies them.
If you're lazy, it makes you lazier. If you're greedy, it helps you steal on a global scale.
Don't blame the tool for a bad craftsman. Build better people, not just better toys.
Always ask who benefits and who pays the price for this "progress."
Real progress is about making life better for everyone, not just easier for some.

- Evelyn Reed"
