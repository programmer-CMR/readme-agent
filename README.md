## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should make life easier, not just faster. If your new system demands constant training, itâ€™s probably poorly designed. Progress isn't about having more gadgets, but about solving real problems effectively. Don't automate things that are broken; fix them first. And remember, the best tech supports human interaction, it doesn't replace it.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
