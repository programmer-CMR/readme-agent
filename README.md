## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, efficiency, even solutions to problems we haven't fully defined yet.
But it doesn't eliminate responsibility.
Implementation requires thoughtful consideration, not blind faith.
Remember, tools amplify intentions, good or bad.
Progress isn't about speed; it's about direction.

- Evelyn Reed, Systems Analyst"
