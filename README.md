## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a magic bullet.
It can solve problems, but it also creates new ones.
Always ask, "What problem are we *really* trying to solve?"
Don't blindly chase the newest trend if it doesn't fit.
Sometimes, the best solution is a simpler one, done well.
- Eleanor Vance, Systems Engineer"
