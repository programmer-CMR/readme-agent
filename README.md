## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a meaningful, direct, and practical quote about technology:

Technologyâ€™s only good if it solves a real problem.
Too many gadgets offer solutions to problems that donâ€™t exist.
Don't get caught up in the hype.
Focus on needs, not trends.
Otherwise, youâ€™re just wasting time and money.
- Anya Sharma"
