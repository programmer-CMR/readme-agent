## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances whether weâ€™re ready or not.
Ignoring its impact doesn't stop the train.
Adapt, learn, or be left behind in the dust.
Donâ€™t mistake convenience for actual progress; assess the cost.
Progress isn't always up; sometimes itâ€™s a detour to somewhere better.
- Elias Thorne"
