## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, not necessarily improvement.

Faster communication doesn't guarantee better understanding.

Innovation alone won't solve problems caused by greed.

Progress without ethics is just a quicker path to disaster.

Remember to ask *why* you're building something, not just *how*.

- Ada Lovelace Chen"
