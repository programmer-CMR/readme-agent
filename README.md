## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances regardless of our preparedness.
Ignoring its impact on jobs is a short-term fix.
Retraining and new skills are now mandatory, not optional.
Companies and governments must invest in adaptation for workers, or face widespread disruption.
The future isn't coming; it's already here, reshaping the present."
- Anita Sharma"
