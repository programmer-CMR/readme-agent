## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, not necessarily solutions. Don't assume faster processing fixes flawed thinking.
Consider the ethical implications before deploying any system, no matter how advanced.
Garbage in, garbage out still applies, only now it happens at the speed of light.
Progress requires critical thinking alongside innovation, not blind acceptance of new tools.
Ultimately, technology is a reflection of humanity, magnifying both our best and worst traits.
- Eleanor Vance, Chief Systems Architect"
