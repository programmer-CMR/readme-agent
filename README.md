## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology fixes problems, it doesn’t erase them.
New tools create new challenges, demanding new solutions.
If you only focus on the shiny object, you’ll trip over the real issues.
Constant progress requires constant adaptation, even uncomfortable ones.
Remember the people using the technology; otherwise, it’s just expensive junk.

- Eleanor Vance"
