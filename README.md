## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems, people do. It amplifies what's already there.
If you're building something new, consider what existing issues you're worsening.
Progress isn't just about faster, cheaper, or more.
It's about better, for everyone, sustainably.
Don't mistake innovation for improvement. Look closer.

- Eleanor Vance"
