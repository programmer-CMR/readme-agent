## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote:

"Technology isn't magic; it's amplified effort.
It can make good work great, or bad work disastrous, faster.
Focus on the problem you're solving, not the tools you're using.
Adopting the 'latest thing' without a clear goal is just busywork.
Measure your impact. Progress is only real if it improves things."

- Grace Hopper Murray"
