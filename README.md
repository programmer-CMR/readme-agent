## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad; it's a tool.
The key is knowing what problem you're actually trying to solve.
Faster isn't always better if you haven't defined "better" first.
Progress should benefit everyone, not just those who create it.
Otherwise, it's just a fancier way to make some people suffer.

- Evelyn Reed, Systems Analyst"
