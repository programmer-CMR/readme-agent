## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it just reshapes them.
Faster communication means faster misunderstandings.
Progress isn't inevitable; it's a choice we make every day.
Innovation without ethics is just faster destruction.
Focus on understanding the consequences, not just the possibilities.

- Eleanor Vance"
