## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; people do. It's a tool, not a magic wand.
Focus on the human using it, not the newest gadget.
Progress isn't about speed, it's about direction.
Ask yourself if what you're building actually helps someone.
If not, you're just making noise.

- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
