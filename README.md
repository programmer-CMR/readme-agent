## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote about technology and progress in a direct, non-poetic style:

"New technology is just a tool. Good intentions don't guarantee good outcomes. Ask yourself: Who really benefits? Who gets left behind? If you can't answer those honestly, then you're just building a fancier problem. Don't mistake novelty for progress. Progress helps everyone."

- Eleanor Vance"
