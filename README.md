## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promised efficiency, but it delivered constant updates and the urgent need for more. Progress isn't always upward; sometimes it's just sideways, and you're still carrying the same baggage. Consider what's truly solved, not just what's newly invented. Obsolescence is the only constant in this game; build for adaptability, not just the present moment. Remember that someone still has to maintain the pipes, no matter how shiny the chrome is. - Eleanor Vance"
