## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is always double-edged. It can streamline a supply chain or spread misinformation globally in seconds. Understand that power comes with responsibility. Before automating jobs, think about the displaced. Before launching a platform, consider the potential for abuse. Never assume progress is inherently good; scrutinize every step.
- Elara Vance, Systems Analyst"
