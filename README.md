## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it creates new ones. Don't be surprised by this.
Always ask: What does this *really* change?
Progress isn't automatic improvement. It's just change.
You have to manage the changes to get the improvements.
Otherwise, you're just running faster in place.

- Eleanor Vance"
