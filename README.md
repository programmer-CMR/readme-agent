## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't fix bad decisions; it just amplifies them.
Faster processing power doesn't equal better thinking.
Progress isn't about having more; it's about doing better.
Don't mistake novelty for improvement; understand the impact.
Always question who benefits most from new advancements.
- Elara Vance"
