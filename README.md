## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not miracles.
Every advancement creates new problems alongside the old ones.
Focus on responsible implementation, not just rapid innovation.
The speed of progress is irrelevant if it leaves people behind.
Measure success by human well-being, not technological prowess.
- Eleanor Vance"
