## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's a tool, not a magic wand.
It amplifies what's already there, good or bad.
If your base data is flawed, you'll just get faster garbage.
So, focus on your core problems, don't expect apps to solve them for you.
Real progress is fixing the root cause, not automating the symptoms.
- Elias Thorne"
