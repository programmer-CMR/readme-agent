## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers shortcuts, not solutions.
Faster doesn't equal better if the basics are ignored.
Progress without planning is just chaos with new toys.
Always ask: what problem are we REALLY solving?
And who benefits the most from this supposed advancement?"
- Evelyn Reed"
