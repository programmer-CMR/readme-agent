## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers solutions, but it also creates problems. Don't be blinded by the shiny new object.

Consider the long-term impact before you blindly adopt any innovation.

Faster and easier doesn't always mean better, or even good.

Look for solutions that improve lives holistically, not just efficiently.

Progress should serve humanity, not the other way around.
- Anya Sharma"
