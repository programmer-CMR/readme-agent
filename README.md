## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology simplifies tasks, yes, but it also creates new dependencies.
Don't assume progress is automatically beneficial; assess the impact.
Improved efficiency doesn't equate to improved quality of life.
Consider the resources consumed and the waste generated, always.
Innovation should solve problems, not simply create more complex ones.
- Elias Thorne"
