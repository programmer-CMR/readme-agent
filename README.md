## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic. It's a tool, plain and simple.
It amplifies what we already are, for good or ill.
Don't expect it to fix problems rooted in human nature.
Invest in understanding people, not just the latest gadget.
Otherwise, you're just building bigger problems, faster.

- Anya Sharma"
