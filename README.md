## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's amplified effort.
It can build empires faster, or crumble them even quicker.
Always consider the purpose of the advancement.
Because a faster route to the wrong destination is still wrong.
Never let the tool dictate the problem you're trying to solve.

- Elias Thorne"
