## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems; it magnifies them. A faster car just gets you to the traffic jam quicker. More data doesn't guarantee better decisions. It just gives you more ways to be wrong. Real progress isn't about more things; it's about better lives, carefully considered.

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
