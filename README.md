## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers speed, but speed without direction just gets you lost faster.
Progress isn't inevitable; it demands careful planning and ethical oversight.
If a tool solves one problem but creates ten more, it's a step backward, not forward.
Always ask: Who benefits? And who gets left behind? Before celebrating anything.
Remember, every innovation leaves a footprint. Someone has to clean it up.

- Elias Thorne"
