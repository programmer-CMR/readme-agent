## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technologyâ€™s value isn't in what it *can* do, but what it *does*.
Shiny new tools are distractions if they don't solve actual problems.
Progress isn't a straight line; it's often two steps forward, one back.
Measure success by improved lives, not by increased complexity.
If itâ€™s not useful, itâ€™s just a really expensive paperweight.

- Eleanor Vance"
