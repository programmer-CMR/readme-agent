## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's that quote:

Technology always seems like the answer until you're cleaning up the messes it makes. Convenience is a sales pitch, not a guarantee. Someone, somewhere, will use your innovation to do something you never intended. Thinking ahead about those unintended consequences is just as important as building the thing itself. Don't be so blinded by the shiny new toy that you forget to ask, "What happens next?"

- Evelyn Reed"
