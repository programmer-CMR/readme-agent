## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances because someone saw a problem and refused to accept the current solution. It's about efficiency, not perfection.
If the goal isn't easier access or a tangible benefit for most people, then all we've created is a shiny toy.
Don't be blinded by the novelty; focus on the utility.
The best innovation improves lives, not just quarterly reports.
Always ask yourself, "Who benefits from this?" And if it's only a select few, re-evaluate.

- Eleanor Vance"
