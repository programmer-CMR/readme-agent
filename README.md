## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology changes the tool, not the problem. Hunger was hunger before tractors, and isolation is isolation with a phone. Progress only moves the battlefield. What mattered yesterday still matters today, just fought with a new weapon. Don't mistake convenience for improvement of character.
- Amelia Earhart"
