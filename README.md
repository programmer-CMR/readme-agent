## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology simplifies tasks, but complicates lives.
New tools demand new skills, and these skills cost time to acquire.
Consider carefully if the "progress" truly makes things better, or just different.
Innovation without ethical consideration is like building a house on sand.
Always ask: who benefits, and at what cost?

- Agnes Thorne"
