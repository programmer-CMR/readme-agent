## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technologyâ€™s only real value is in making life objectively better for more people.
It isn't about the latest gadget or the fastest speed.
Itâ€™s about lifting the poorest, educating the ignorant, and healing the sick.
If your invention doesnâ€™t do that, itâ€™s just noise.
And noise pollutes progress more than anything else.
- Eleanor Vance, Practical Engineering Advocate."
