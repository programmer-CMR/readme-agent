## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's amplified humanity.
Every tool has a purpose, but also consequences.
Progress demands responsibility, not just advancement.
If we don't control the machine, it will control us.
So, learn the basics, question everything, and choose wisely.
- Elias Thorne"
