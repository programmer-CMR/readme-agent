## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology fixes problems, but also creates new ones.
Faster isn't always better if it breaks what already works.
Think about the consequences before you automate everything.
Data is only as good as the questions you ask of it.
Real progress means everyone benefits, not just a few.
- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
