## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology amplifies who we are.
If your intentions are good, it builds a better world, faster.
If they're selfish, it spreads damage on a global scale.
Blind adoption without considering consequences is just reckless.
Focus on solving real problems, not creating new ones.
- Eleanor Vance"
