## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is never a finished product. It's always beta.
Expect things to break, to be exploited, and to need patching.
Don't get seduced by the new; focus on the useful.
Constant upgrades require constant vigilance, or youâ€™ll be left behind.
If it seems too good to be true, it probably harvests your data.

- Ada Lovelace Holleran"
