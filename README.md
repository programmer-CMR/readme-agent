## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't automatically progress. It's a tool.
A faster hammer doesn't build a better house if you're using the wrong nails, or if the foundation is cracked.
Focus on *why* you're building, and *who* benefits.
Otherwise, you're just making problems happen faster.
Constant innovation without purpose is just expensive noise.

- Eleanor Vance"
