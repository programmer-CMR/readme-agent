## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's a tool.
It can amplify good intentions or disastrous flaws.
Focus on clear goals, not just the shiny new thing.
If it doesn't solve a real problem, it's just noise.
Measure its impact beyond clicks and downloads, measure real change.

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
