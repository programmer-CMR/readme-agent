## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances whether we're ready or not.
Ignoring it is a career limiter, plain and simple.
Adapt, learn the new tools, or get left behind.
Don't romanticize the "good old days" if they can't get the job done now.
Progress demands constant retooling, both in machines and minds.

- Elizabeth Chen"
