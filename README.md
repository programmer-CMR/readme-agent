> "Here's a quote in the requested style:

"Technology doesn't solve problems; people do. It's just a tool. A faster hammer doesn't automatically build a better house, especially if you don't know how to swing it. Focus on training and understanding, not just buying the newest gadget. Otherwise, you're just creating expensive garbage. If you build it, train them, or it will fail."
- Anya Sharma"
