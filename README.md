## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency. It delivers complexity just as often.
Evaluate its actual benefit. Look beyond the marketing.
Does it truly solve a problem, or simply create new dependencies?
If the cost outweighs the gain, it's a step backward, not forward.
Progress is not about faster speeds; it's about better lives.
- Elias Thorne"
