## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it changes them.
Every advance comes with a new set of challenges.
Focus on adapting, not just inventing.
Don't automate stupidity; fix the broken process first.
If it breaks, understand *why*, or you're doomed to repeat it.

- Amelia Stone"
