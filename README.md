## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology fixes some problems, creates new ones. Donâ€™t assume progress is automatic; it demands vigilance. Every innovation benefits someone, harms another. Question the net effect, not just the potential. Code and concrete are just tools; wisdom dictates their use.

- Anya Sharma"
