## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't just lines of code or faster chips.
It's about solving real problems for real people.
Does this invention feed the hungry? Educate the ignorant?
Connect those who are lonely? Make lives genuinely better?
If not, it's just another shiny distraction.

- Ada Augusta King"
