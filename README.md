## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it shifts them.
Faster isn't always better, just faster.
Progress without planning is just expensive chaos.
Consider the consequences of every digital click.
Future innovations depend on learning from past mistakes.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
