## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's only as good as the problems it solves. Don't chase the shiny new thing just because it's there. Focus on real needs, real inefficiencies.
If it doesnâ€™t make someoneâ€™s life easier or more productive, it's just noise.
And remember, every tool can be used for good or ill. Choose wisely.

- Ada Lovelace Jr."
