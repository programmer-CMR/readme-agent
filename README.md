## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool. Itâ€™s not inherently good or bad.
Its value is defined solely by its purpose.
If it saves time only to waste more, itâ€™s a problem, not progress.
Constant upgrades without improvements are just expensive distractions.
Focus on *how* the tech is solving your problems, not *that* it exists.

- Eleanor Vance, Chief Efficiency Analyst"
