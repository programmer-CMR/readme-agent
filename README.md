## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a solution. Building better tech doesn't automatically build a better world. Focus on *why* you're creating it, and *who* will be affected. If you don't understand the problem, your fancy gadget will only make things worse, faster. Remember, progress without purpose is just expensive noise.
- Anya Sharma"
