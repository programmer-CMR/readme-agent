## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should be a tool, not a master.
It is meant to solve problems, not create new ones.
Focus on what problems are actually worth solving first.
Otherwise, you will just be making faster mistakes.
Progress is not just about new things; it's about better lives.
- Elias Thorne"
