## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't fix human problems; it magnifies them.
A faster horse won't win you a car race.
Focus on what you want to achieve, not just the tools you use.
Progress without ethics is just a faster path to disaster.
Always question whether the 'new' way is actually better.
- Commander Ada Lovelace"
