## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't wait for permission, but it absolutely requires direction.
Just because we *can* build something doesn't mean we *should*, especially if it's destructive.
Constant innovation must be coupled with responsible implementation.
Forget blind faith; demand proof that the intended outcome is actually delivered.
Impact is everything, and unintended consequences are unacceptable failures.

- Elias Thorne"
