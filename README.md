## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad.
It's a tool. A hammer can build a house or break a skull.
Focus on the outcome you want to achieve
before you start chasing the newest gadget.
Progress is measured by how many people benefit, not how many new features are added.

- Ada Lovelace Turing"
