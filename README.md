## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't neutral. It amplifies what's already there.
Good intentions can build bridges, but bad ones create bigger bombs.
Always ask who benefits. If the answer is only a few, be wary.
Progress should make life better for everyone, not just some.
Don't mistake faster for better. Think about the consequences first.
