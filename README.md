## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technologyâ€™s promise isn't just shiny new things.
It's about making real life better for everyone, not just some.
If it widens the gap, it's failing its purpose.
Focus on solutions that truly help people, not just profits.
Otherwise, progress becomes just another form of inequality.
- Anya Sharma"
