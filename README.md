## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency. It rarely delivers simplicity.
Adoption isn't automatic; people adapt at their own pace.
New tools require new training. Neglecting that is a recipe for chaos.
Progress often creates new problems, demanding further solutions.
Remember, technology should serve humanity, not the other way around.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
