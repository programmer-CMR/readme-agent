## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not utopia.
Every advance carries a new set of problems to solve.
Don't assume progress means things automatically get better for everyone.
Always question the impact, especially on those with the least power.
Constant change demands constant vigilance and adaptation, not blind faith.
- Elias Vance"
