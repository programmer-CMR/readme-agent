## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones.
Focusing solely on speed and efficiency ignores the human cost.
Progress isn't linear; setbacks are inevitable and valuable.
Don't mistake shiny gadgets for actual societal improvement.
Always question who benefits most from any innovation.

- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
