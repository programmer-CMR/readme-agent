## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, but demands accountability. Faster doesn’t equal better, only faster. Always ask: who benefits, and at what cost? Progress isn’t inevitable; it's a choice requiring continuous evaluation. Don't let the shiny new thing distract you from the core problem.

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
