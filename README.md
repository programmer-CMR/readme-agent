## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad; it's a tool.
If you build faster systems, you'd better train faster minds to use them.
Progress should solve real problems for real people.
Don't chase novelty for the sake of novelty.
Otherwise you will just build a mountain of expensive, useless gadgets.
- Evelyn Reed"
