## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances because someone, somewhere, needs it to. Itâ€™s driven by practical problems, not abstract dreams. Just because we *can* build something doesn't mean we *should*, or that itâ€™s actually progress for everyone. Don't let shiny new toys distract you from who benefits and who pays the price. The best tech solves a real need effectively and ethically.
- Evelyn Reed"
