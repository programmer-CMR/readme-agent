## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a savior.
Faster doesn't automatically mean better for anyone.
Progress should raise everyone, not just the wealthy.
We build new things, but forget old lessons at our peril.
Judge technology by the problems it solves for the vulnerable.

- Eleanor Vance"
