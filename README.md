## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't automatically fix problems; it just moves them.
Faster processing doesn't equal better decisions.
Innovation is worthless if nobody can use it.
Remember the people at the end of the chain, the ones who implement.
Real progress is making life easier, not just more complicated.

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
