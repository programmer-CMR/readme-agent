## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's applied effort.
It amplifies what we already are, good or bad.
Faster isn't always better if it's heading the wrong way.
Constant innovation demands constant ethical questioning.
The best tool is the one that actually solves the problem.

- Alan Turing"
