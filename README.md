## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology should solve problems, not create new ones disguised as convenience. We're building tools, not gods. If it requires more attention than it provides freedom, it’s a bad investment. Always ask who benefits, and at what cost, before embracing the next shiny thing. Practicality and sustainability should be the only metrics that truly matter.

- Anya Sharma"
