## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology only solves problems that humans create. It’s a tool, like a hammer.
Use it to build, but remember you can smash things too.
Progress isn't about faster machines; it's about better choices.
Focus on the user, not the gadget.
Because innovation without ethics is just efficient destruction.
- Elias Thorne"
