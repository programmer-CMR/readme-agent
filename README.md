## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones.
Don't assume progress is always forward. Sometimes it's just sideways.
Real improvement means making life better for everyone, not just some.
Innovation without a plan is just expensive noise.
Remember the human cost of disruption. It's never zero.

- Elsie Maynard"
