## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but demands constant vigilance.
Each new tool creates new dependencies and vulnerabilities.
Forget the hype: Measure progress by genuine problem-solving.
If it doesn't improve lives beyond profit margins, it's just noise.
Always ask who benefits, and at whose expense."
- Anya Sharma"
