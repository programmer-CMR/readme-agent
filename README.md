## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology fixes problems, yes, but it also changes the playing field. What was once solved with ingenuity might now need a server farm. The advantage goes to those who understand both the new tools and the underlying challenges. Efficiency isn't always progress if it comes at the cost of understanding. Adapt, or be adapted.

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
