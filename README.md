## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't a magic wand. It's a tool, a lever.
Progress comes from using it intentionally,
not just building something because you can.
Consider the consequences beyond the immediate reward,
or you're just creating new problems with faster solutions.
- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
