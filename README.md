## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers new tools, not new ethics. Build better, but remember why. Faster access to information demands faster critical thinking, not just acceptance. Progress isn't inevitable, it requires constant evaluation of its impact. If it helps some by harming others, itâ€™s a flawed system needing repair, not blind celebration.
- Anya Sharma"
