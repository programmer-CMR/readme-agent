## 📅 Daily Quote

> "New tech solves old problems, sure. But it also makes new ones we never even thought of.
Don't get so caught up in the shine that you forget to check if the foundation is cracking.
Every advance comes with a cost. Someone, somewhere, is paying it.
So before you automate everything, ask yourself: who loses their job? Who loses their voice?
Progress isn’t just about what’s *possible*. It's about what's *right*."
- Grace Hopper"
