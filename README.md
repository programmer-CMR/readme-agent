## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology offers potential. It can ease burdens and connect people.
But the tools themselves are neutral.
Their impact depends entirely on who controls them and the reasons why.
Remember that a hammer can build a house or break a skull.
Constant vigilance and critical thinking are essential, not optional.
- Eleanor Vance"
