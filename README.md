## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology gives us speed, efficiency, and reach, but remember:

Faster doesn't always mean better if the destination is wrong.

Efficiency gains are worthless if the system is fundamentally flawed.

Broader reach amplifies both good and bad ideas alike.

Always check the human impact before celebrating the technical win."

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
