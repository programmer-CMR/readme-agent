## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises a better future, but it doesnâ€™t guarantee it.
You still have to build that future, brick by brick.
New tools don't replace hard work, only change its form.
Ethics must advance alongside innovation, or progress becomes a curse.
Don't confuse faster with better; efficiency without purpose is pointless.
- General Alistair Blackwood"
