## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't fix broken systems; it amplifies them.
If your processes are inefficient now, they'll be exponentially
inefficient with automation. Focus first on streamlining,
simplifying, and training your people. Tech is the accelerator,
not the foundation.
- Alice McGregor"
