## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a destiny. It amplifies what we already are.
If we use it to divide and exploit, it will do so with terrifying speed.
Progress isn't inevitable; it's a conscious choice made every day.
Focus on building better humans, not just better machines.
Otherwise, we'll just become highly efficient at destroying ourselves.
- Dr. Anya Sharma, Professor of Applied Ethics"
