## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise isn't a guarantee.
It's a tool, and like any tool, it can build or destroy.
The speed it offers demands greater responsibility, not less.
Focus on the problem you're solving, not the technology itself.
Otherwise, you're just making faster mistakes.

- Eleanor Vance"
