## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise isn't just about what it *can* do, but what it *should* do.
We keep focusing on speed and convenience, but forget about impact.
If it isolates us more than it connects us, it's failing.
The real progress is in making technology accessible to everyone, not just the privileged few.
Remember to ask: Does this really solve a problem, or just create a new one?
- Evelyn Reed"
