## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad; itâ€™s a tool.
The problem isnâ€™t its existence, but how we use it and who benefits.
Progress without ethical consideration is just change, not improvement.
Focus on solving real problems, not chasing the newest shiny gadget.
Remember, technology should serve humanity, not the other way around.
- Alan Turing"
