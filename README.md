## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise isn't just faster, brighter, or cheaper.
It's about empowering people to solve real problems themselves.
Progress means more than just a new gadget in your pocket.
It's about tangible improvements in the lives of everyone, everywhere.
If it doesn't do that, it's just a distraction.

- Evelyn Reed"
