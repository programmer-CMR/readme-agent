## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems; it magnifies them.
Good intentions are useless without understanding the consequences.
Faster isn't always better; sometimes, it's just faster to screw things up.
Progress requires constant questioning, not blind acceptance.
If you can't fix a problem with a hammer, a robot won't help either.

- Dr. Elizabeth Thorne"
