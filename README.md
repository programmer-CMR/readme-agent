## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it always creates new ones.
The faster we move, the bigger those new problems become.
Don't be blinded by the shiny object; consider the cost.
Progress isn't free, and it's rarely as simple as it looks.
If you're not thinking about the consequences, you're not thinking at all."
- Evelyn Reed"
