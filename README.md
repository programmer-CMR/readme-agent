## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technologyâ€™s supposed to make things easier, not replace common sense. Just because you *can* automate something doesnâ€™t automatically mean you *should*. We've gotten so good at creating complex systems that weâ€™ve forgotten how to solve basic problems without them. Check if the damn thing is even plugged in before you call tech support. Progress without purpose is just noisy motion.
- Eleanor Vance"
