## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems; it amplifies human choices.
If we build better tools, but not better people to wield them,
we just get bigger messes, faster.
Progress isn't inevitable, only change is.
So, are we shaping the future, or is it shaping us?
Think about that before you automate another task.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
