## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but watch its fine print.
Every innovation creates a new set of problems, often unforeseen.
Don't blindly trust algorithms; they reflect the biases of their creators.
Progress without ethical consideration is a runaway train.
Understand the consequences before embracing the next "game-changer."
- Elias Thorne"
