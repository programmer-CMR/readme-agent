## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad; it's a tool.
It amplifies existing human tendencies, both positive and negative.
Focus solely on advancement without ethical consideration,
and you're building a faster route to the wrong destination.
Don't mistake speed for progress, know where you're going.
- Alice Chen"
