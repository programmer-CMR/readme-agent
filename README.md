## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't neutral. It's a tool, and tools amplify the user.
If you build a hammer, you'll see more nails.
If you build a social network, you'll see more connection, but also more division.
Control the design, or the design will control you.
Always ask, "What problems are we *creating*, not just solving?"

- Evelyn Hayes"
