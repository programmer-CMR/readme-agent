## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here is a quote following your guidelines:

Technology gives you power, but it doesn't give you wisdom.
Faster isn't always better if it means sacrificing safety.
Progress is only progress if it benefits everyone, not just a few.
Don't let shiny new tools distract you from the problems you're trying to solve.
Remember that technology is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or bad.

- Evelyn Reed"
