## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote that fits the criteria:

"New tech solves problems. That's true. But it *also* creates new ones. Don't be blinded by the shiny object.
Before you implement anything, think about the long-term cost.
Think about the security risks.
Think about who gets left behind.
Because progress isn't progress if it just benefits a few."
- Anya Sharma"
