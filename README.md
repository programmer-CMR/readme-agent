## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not miracles. It's a tool.
Don't expect it to solve problems it wasn't designed to fix, or problems that are fundamentally human.
Before you automate, understand the process thoroughly. Otherwise, you'll just automate mistakes faster.
Training and adaptation are essential. New tech creates new skills requirements.
Focus on the problem first. The tech is there to serve, not lead.

- Alice Caldwell"
