## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's amplified effort.
Progress isn't guaranteed, it's a choice we make daily.
Every new tool demands responsibility, not just celebration.
Understand the limitations of the screen, not just the possibilities.
If it doesn't improve real lives, it's a distraction, not progress.

- Anya Sharma"
