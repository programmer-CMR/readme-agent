## ğŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress doesn't mean better, it means different. Understand what's being replaced.
Will it increase connection, or just dependency?
New tools demand new responsibility, not just new features.
Don't let shiny distract you from sustainable.
If it doesn't solve a real problem, it's just a distraction."
- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
