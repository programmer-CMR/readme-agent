## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, but reality demands understanding. New tools don't solve old problems; they reshape them. Progress isn't inevitable; it's a choice. Focus on the problem first, then choose the tech. Don't let shiny objects blind you to fundamental flaws.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
