## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers solutions, but it also presents new problems.
Don't blindly embrace advancement without considering the consequences.
Implementation matters more than innovation itself.
Constant upgrades don't always equate to genuine improvement.
Focus on using technology to address real human needs first.
- Eleanor Vance"
