## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, sure, but it also creates new ones. Don't be naive.
Every advancement comes with a cost, visible or hidden. Be prepared to pay it.
Progress isn't a straight line upward; it's a jagged path forward, with detours.
Just because something can be done, doesn't mean it should be. Think it through.
Focus on the real-world impact, not just the theoretical potential. What matters is how people live.
- Evelyn Reed"
