> "Here's that quote:

Technology's promise isn't just shiny gadgets. It's about fixing what's broken in the real world. Can it get food to more people? Can it improve healthcare access? Can it clean up the planet? If not, it's just a distraction.
These are the questions we should be asking, before the hype takes over.

- Ada Lovelace Velez"
