## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances. It's inevitable. But focusing solely on speed ignores the actual problems we need to solve. Will this new gadget feed the hungry? Educate the ignorant? Protect the vulnerable? If not, it's just a distraction. Measure progress by the good it does, not the gigahertz it boasts."
- Elias Thorne"
