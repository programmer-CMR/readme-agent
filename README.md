## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it creates new ones too.
Don't assume newer is always better; understand the trade-offs.
Think about the resources used to build it and the waste it generates.
Progress isn’t just faster and cheaper; it’s sustainable and ethical.
Consider who benefits and who is left behind in the rush to innovate.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
