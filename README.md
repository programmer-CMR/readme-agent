## 📅 Daily Quote

> "New tools don't fix old problems; they just create new ones, often bigger and faster. If you haven't addressed the human element – the training, the understanding, the ethical considerations – then all you've done is amplified your existing flaws. Efficiency without purpose is chaos. Progress isn't a destination, it's a constant negotiation with unintended consequences. Always ask 'What could go wrong?'"
- Elizabeth Chen"
