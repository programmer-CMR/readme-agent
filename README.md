## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is a tool, not a solution.
Faster doesn't always mean better, smarter, or more fair.
Look at what it *does*, not just what it *can* do.
Progress isn't a straight line; prepare for detours and mistakes.
If it benefits only a few, it's not progress for everyone.

- Eleanor Vance"
