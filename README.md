## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic. It's a tool.
If the problem is garbage in, you'll get garbage out, no matter how shiny the tool.
Progress shouldn't be about more; it's about better for everyone.
Asking "can we" isn't the same as asking "should we."
Focus on what the tech *solves* more than the tech itself.

- Eleanor Vance"
