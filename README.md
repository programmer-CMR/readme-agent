## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad. Itâ€™s a tool.
A faster hammer doesn't automatically build better houses,
it just makes mistakes faster. Progress isn't just speed;
it's aiming the tool in the right direction and ensuring
everyone benefits, not just the few holding the blueprints.
- Eleanor Vance, Systems Analyst"
