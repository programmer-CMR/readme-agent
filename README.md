## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a solution.
Faster isn't always better; think about what you're actually building.
Progress demands accountability. If it breaks, you fix it.
Ignoring the consequences of your inventions is negligence.
Measure success by real improvements in people's lives, not just market share."
- Ada Lovelace"
