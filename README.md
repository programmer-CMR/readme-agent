## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't inherently solve problems; it amplifies what's already there.
If your processes were broken before automation, they'll be broken faster now.
Innovation without ethical consideration is just reckless change.
Remember, faster doesn't always mean better, especially when it impacts people.
Ask yourself if technology is serving humanity or the other way around.
- Evelyn Hayes"
