## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise isn't just shiny new gadgets.
It's about making life easier for everyone, not just some.
If progress increases inequality, it's not progress at all.
Focus on real problems and sustainable solutions, not just hype.
Measure your impact by lives improved, not dollars earned.
- Elias Thorne"
