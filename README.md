## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's just a tool.
If that tool's code isn't checked, things break.
Progress demands responsibility for every line.
Otherwise, you're just building faster disasters.
Always ask: Who benefits, and at what cost?

- Evelyn Ramirez, Software Reliability Engineer"
