## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances regardless of our readiness. New tools will emerge, solving old problems while creating fresh ones.
Adaptation is no longer a choice, it's a prerequisite for survival. Understand its implications, not just its features.
Ignorance of progress isn't bliss, it's unemployment and obsolescence. Actively learn, question relentlessly, use wisely.
Don't blindly trust the hype, critically assess the value. Focus on application, not just innovation for its own sake.
Progress will continue regardless of our participation, but only our understanding will ensure we're not left behind.

- Elias Vance"
