## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones, faster.
Understand this basic principle: progress is never free.
Every convenience you gain comes at a cost, somewhere.
Check the fine print before you embrace the shiny object.
Be aware of what you are trading for that perceived benefit.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
