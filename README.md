## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology improves things, but not automatically.
You still need to fix the problems it causes.
Think about the downsides before you implement anything new.
If it doesn't solve a real problem, it's just a distraction.
Focus on useful applications, not just novelty.
- Evelyn Reed"
