## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises progress, but progress isn't guaranteed.
New tools amplify existing human tendencies, good and bad.
Consider the ethical implications before widespread adoption.
Implementation is harder than invention. Expect setbacks.
Focus on solving real problems for real people first.

- Elara Vance, Systems Engineer"
