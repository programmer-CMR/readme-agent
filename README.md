## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems. It amplifies them.
If you're unethical, tech makes you an efficient unethical person.
If you're greedy, tech lets you grab more, faster.
Don't mistake faster problem-making for progress.
Genuine improvement requires better people, not just better tools.
- Admiral Grace Hopper"
