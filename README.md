## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's purpose is to solve problems, not create new ones.
If it doesn't simplify daily life, it's just a shiny distraction.
Progress isn't measured by speed, but by actual improvement.
Focus on accessibility and utility, not just innovation for its own sake.
Never assume new tech is automatically better than what came before.

- Eleanor Vance"
