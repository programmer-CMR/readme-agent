## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, nothing more.
It can build, and it can break.
Progress isn't guaranteed just because something is new.
Understand the problem you're solving, or you're just adding noise.
Always ask what a technology *removes* as well as what it provides.

- Grace Evelyn Harper"
