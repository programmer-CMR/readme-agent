## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here's one:

Technology should solve problems, not create new ones disguised as solutions. Before you automate, understand the process. Before you connect, consider the security. Before you amplify, think about the signal. Always ask, "What is the real cost?" This isn't about stopping progress, it's about responsible progress.

- Janet Ito"
