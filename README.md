## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises a better future, but itâ€™s just a tool.
It amplifies what we already are, good or bad.
Faster communication doesn't guarantee better understanding.
Progress isn't linear, and new problems will always arise.
Remember that convenience is not a substitute for critical thinking.
- Elias Thorne"
