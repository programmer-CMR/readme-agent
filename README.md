## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances. That's a fact.
But progress isn't automatic; it requires mindful direction.
New tools can solve old problems, but also create new ones.
Always ask: Who benefits? Who is left behind?
Because technology in itself is just potential, good or bad.
- Anya Sharma, Urban Planner"
