## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but efficiency demands choices.
Those choices always cost something, even if it isn't money.
Understand that every advancement creates a new dependency.
Never let the ease of a tool blind you to the skill it replaces.
Always ask: Is it truly making things better, or just faster?

- Eleanor Vance"
