## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technologyâ€™s promise is efficiency, not necessarily improvement.
Faster transactions donâ€™t equal better decisions.
Increased connectivity doesnâ€™t guarantee genuine connection.
Advancement demands questioning, not blind acceptance.
Real progress is what solves actual human problems, not just creates new gadgets.
- Evelyn Reed"
