## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool. Like a hammer, it can build a house or smash a window.
Its value is defined not by its cleverness, but by the intention of the user.
Progress isn't automatic; it's a series of choices, often difficult ones.
Think carefully before automating yourself out of a job.
And remember, a shiny new app doesn't solve problems created by bad leadership.

- Evelyn Reed"
