## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology advances, but usefulness is not guaranteed.
Focus on solving problems, not just building new gadgets.
If it complicates daily life more than it helps, rethink it.
Progress isn't about faster speeds; it's about better lives.
Always ask who benefits and who's left behind.

- Evelyn Reed"
