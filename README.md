## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is efficient solutions, but it's always more complex than the sales pitch suggests. Remember to factor in the learning curve, the inevitable bugs, and the ongoing maintenance. Don't automate a bad process; you'll just scale the problem. If it's not making your life easier in a tangible way, reconsider its value. Evaluate the real cost against the supposed benefits, and don't get caught in the hype.

- Ada Lovelace III"
