## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems; it amplifies them. If your people are greedy, tech gives them faster ways to grab more. If they're divided, it provides louder megaphones. Focus on fixing the underlying issues before trusting any new shiny thing to save you. It's a tool, not a savior. Learn to use it wisely, or it will use you.
- Elara Vance, Systems Analyst"
