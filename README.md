## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; people using technology do.
New tools just amplify existing abilities and flaws.
Don't mistake faster for better â€“ consider the consequences.
Progress isn't a straight line; it's a series of stumbles forward.
Always question who benefits and who pays the price of any advancement.

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
