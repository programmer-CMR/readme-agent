## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems; it magnifies them. If you have bad intentions, a computer just lets you do bad things faster and at scale. Progress isn't about the tools, it's about the ethics that guide their use. Always consider the unintended consequences because someone, somewhere, will find a way to misuse it. If it can be used to harm, it will be.

- Ada Lovelace VI"
