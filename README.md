## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technologyâ€™s promise is always faster, cheaper, and more.

But speed doesnâ€™t equal wisdom. Cost savings can hide hidden expenses.

More things often just create more problems.

So before you jump at the newest gadget, ask yourself: is this truly useful?

Or is it just another distraction dressed up as progress?
