## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers a lever, not a solution.
Faster communication doesn't guarantee better understanding.
Automation promises freedom, demands new skills.
Progress isn't inevitable; it requires directed effort.
Remember, the power to build also carries the power to destroy.

- Ada Lovelace"
