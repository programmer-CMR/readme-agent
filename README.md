## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't automatically fix problems; it magnifies existing strengths and weaknesses.
If your process was broken before, it's now broken faster, and potentially for more people.
Implement new systems strategically. Start small, test thoroughly, and train comprehensively.
Ignoring the human elementâ€”the users, the maintainers, the potential victimsâ€”is a recipe for disaster.
Remember, just because you *can* automate something doesn't always mean you *should*.

- Amelia Stone"
