## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it changes them.
Faster isn't always better, think about the costs.
Progress should improve lives, not just profit margins.
If it breaks more than it fixes, reconsider the design.
Responsible innovation needs foresight, not just speed.

- Anya Sharma, Chief Engineer"
