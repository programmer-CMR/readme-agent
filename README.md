## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it's rarely a complete fix.
Always consider the unintended consequences.
Faster isn't always better if it breaks everything else.
Progress demands we adapt, constantly learning new tools.
Don't let the tools use you; keep control of the process.
- Susan Calvin"
