> "Here's that quote:

"New tech doesn't solve old problems. It amplifies them. A faster car means a faster crash. A bigger database means a bigger leak. If your systems are broken, better software just makes the break happen quicker and to more people. Fix the foundations before you build the skyscraper, or it'll all come down.

- Elias Thorne"
