## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology changes how we do things, not who we are.
Faster doesn't always mean better; consider the costs.
Progress without purpose is just running in circles.
The newest tool is useless if you don't understand the problem.
Fix your actual problems first, then buy the tech."
- Eleanor Vance"
