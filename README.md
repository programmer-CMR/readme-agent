## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a savior.
Progress only matters if it benefits everyone.
Don't confuse innovation with improvement.
Constant upgrades can be expensive distractions.
Focus on making technology serve your needs, not the other way around.
- Dr. Anya Sharma, Societal Engineer"
