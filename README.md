## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology only truly advances when it solves real problems for actual people, not just creates new ones we didn't know we had. Faster isn't always better; consider the consequences. Progress needs a direction, not just momentum. Don't mistake complexity for sophistication. If it's not making life easier or fairer for most, it's just another toy for the few.
- Elias Thorne"
