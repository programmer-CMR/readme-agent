## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's value isn't in what it *can* do, but what it *actually* does for people.
Faster isn't automatically better if it makes things harder to understand or more difficult to use.
Progress demands we constantly re-evaluate our tools, not just celebrate them.
A shiny new invention is only worth the effort if it tackles a real-world problem.
Don't get so lost in the future that you forget the needs of the present.

- Anya Sharma"
