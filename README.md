## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's only valuable when it solves real problems.
Faster isn't always better; consider the consequences.
Progress without purpose is just noise and waste.
Learn the basics first, understand the 'why' behind the 'how'.
Adaptability is key; the future's never written in stone.
- Anya Sharma, Systems Engineer"
