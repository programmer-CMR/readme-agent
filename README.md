## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, but remember this:

It magnifies existing problems as efficiently as it solves them.
Increased connectivity doesn't automatically create understanding.
Faster speeds don't guarantee better decisions.
Progress without ethics is just amplified risk.
Always factor in the human element, or be prepared to pay the price.

- Eleanor Vance"
