## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it amplifies existing ones. A poorly designed process becomes a faster poorly designed process. Ethics should guide every line of code, every circuit board, every algorithm. If it doesn't, progress becomes a reckless drive toward an unknown cliff. User experience matters, not just fancy features.

- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
