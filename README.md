## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology offers tools, not solutions. A hammer builds, but it also breaks. Progress isn't automatic; it requires understanding the consequences of each new device and system we create. Innovation without ethical oversight is simply reckless experimentation on a massive scale. The biggest risk isn't technology itself, but a lack of critical thinking about its applications.
- Evelyn Reed"
