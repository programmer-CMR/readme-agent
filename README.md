## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems, people do. It amplifies what's already there, good and bad.
Don't mistake faster processing for better thinking.
Constant upgrades aren't progress if they break what worked yesterday.
Question the system, not just the interface.
Build for resilience, not just for speed.
- Elias Thorne"
