## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but always creates new ones.
Don't assume progress is inherently good; it's a tool.
Focus on responsible use and understanding consequences.
Ignoring potential downsides means paying for them later.
Adapt, learn, and stay critical in a rapidly changing world.

- Anya Sharma"
