## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't inherently good, it's inherently neutral.
Technology amplifies what we already are.
If we're greedy and short-sighted, it makes us more so, faster.
Itâ€™s a tool, not a savior. Use it responsibly, or it will bury you.
Think long-term, not just about the immediate shiny object.
- Elias Thorne"
