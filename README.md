## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not miracles.

Every advancement comes with a cost, even if you don't see it upfront.

Progress isn't inherently good; it's just amplified power.

Learn the risks before you embrace the reward, or you will regret it.

We are creating the world we will live in tomorrow, make sure it is one you want.

- Elias Thorne"
