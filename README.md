## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers potential solutions, but it also amplifies existing problems.
Faster isn't always better; it's just faster.
Progress without ethical considerations is simply a more efficient disaster.
Focus on needs, not just capabilities, when building new tools.
Remember: the future arrives one line of code, one policy decision, at a time.
- Eleanor Vance"
