## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances whether we're ready or not.
Ignoring its implications doesn't make them disappear.
We build these tools; we must understand their uses.
Every innovation carries both promise and potential harm.
Focus on the ethical considerations, not just the speed.
- Anya Sharma"
