## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's value isn't in its potential; it's in its application.
Shiny new tools that gather dust on shelves are useless.
Progress means making lives demonstrably better, for everyone.
Focus less on innovation and more on sustainable integration.
Consider the real-world impact before pursuing the next big thing.
- Eleanor Vance"
