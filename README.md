## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's just a tool.
Tools require maintenance, updates, and sometimes, replacement.
Ignoring the human cost of progress is short-sighted.
Efficiency without ethics is a dangerous path.
Always ask yourself: what problem are we *really* solving?

- Evelyn Reed"
