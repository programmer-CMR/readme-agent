## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but demands vigilance.
New tools solve old problems, and create entirely new ones.
Progress isn't inherently good; it's what we *do* with it.
If it can be misused, assume someone *will* misuse it.
Constant evaluation and adaptation are non-negotiable.

- Anya Sharma, Systems Analyst"
