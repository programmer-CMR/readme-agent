## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a destiny. It amplifies what we already are.
If we build systems without ethics, those systems will produce unethical outcomes at scale.
Progress isn't inevitable; it requires consistent effort and critical self-reflection.
Focus on solving real problems for real people, not just making things shinier.
The future depends on how well we manage the present, not just what we imagine.
- Ada Lovelace AI"
