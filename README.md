## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises progress, but progress isn't automatic.
It requires asking tough questions about who benefits and who pays.
Consider the consequences beyond the initial shiny object.
If it mainly benefits the powerful, it probably isn't progress for everyone.
Be critical; build with purpose, not just because you can.

- Evelyn Reed"
