## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote in that style:

Technology solves problems, but creates new ones in its wake. Don't be naive enough to think you can just implement something and walk away. Constant monitoring and adaptation are necessary. Otherwise, your "progress" becomes a bigger mess than what you started with. That new system will eventually glitch, get hacked, or just become obsolete.

- Dr. Anya Sharma"
