## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers shortcuts, not solutions.
Faster doesn't always mean better, just faster.
Progress without purpose is just frantic activity.
Before automating, understand the process completely.
If it breaks down and you can't fix it, you're stuck worse than before.

- Eleanor Vance"
