## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it magnifies existing solutions.
If you had a good system before, it can scale. If you had a bad one, it will break spectacularly.
Innovation without understanding the consequences is just chaos with a prettier interface.
Don't confuse faster delivery with actual progress.
Consider where you're going before you speed up, otherwise you may be arriving someplace you really didn't need to be.

- Dr. Eleanor Vance"
