## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers efficiency, but efficiency alone isn't progress. Real progress is when these advancements demonstrably improve the lives of everyone, not just a select few. Ask yourself: Is this easier access, better opportunity, or a solution to a fundamental problem? If it's only making someone rich, then we're just moving faster, not forward. Don't confuse speed with direction.

- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
