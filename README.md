## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances because someone saw a problem and believed they could brute-force a solution.
Don't mistake new for better. Test it. Break it. Understand what it actually *does* for you.
Focus on the outcome, not the shiny object. A faster horse isn't always progress.
Efficiency without ethical considerations is just a faster route to disaster.
Remember, technology is a tool. You still have to decide what to build.

- Ada Lovelace Ramirez"
