## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology offers a lever, but not a solution.
Implementation still requires intention, planning, and resources.
New tools amplify existing strengths and weaknesses.
If your process was broken before, it will now be broken faster.
So fix your foundations before building higher.
- Evelyn Hayes"
