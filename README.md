## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones.
Every advance requires careful planning, not just celebration.
Faster isn't always better; consider the long-term impact.
Progress benefits everyone, or it's not really progress at all.
Blindly adopting change leads to unexpected consequences.

- Anya Sharma, Systems Engineer"
