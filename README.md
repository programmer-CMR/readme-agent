> "Here's your quote:

"Don't mistake innovation for improvement. Just because something *can* be done faster with technology, doesn't mean it *should* be done that way. Evaluate the actual benefit. Consider the cost, both financial and human. Look at who truly profits. Only then can you say technology has truly moved us forward, not just sideways at high speed."
- Elias Thorne"
