## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't a straight line. Expect failures, learn from them.
Technology amplifies what already exists; good and bad.
Focus on the problem first, then apply the tech. Don't chase shiny objects.
Measure actual impact, not just clicks or impressions.
If it doesn't solve a real need, it's just expensive noise."
- Eleanor Vance"
