## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, not necessarily improvement.
Faster output doesn't automatically mean higher quality.
Consider who benefits most from any new development.
Progress without planning is just more problems, quicker.
Ask yourself if this genuinely makes life better, or just different.

- Evelyn Reed, Systems Analyst"
