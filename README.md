## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems, it amplifies them. A good tool in bad hands builds a bigger mess. Focus on the operator, not just the instrument. Better infrastructure is only as good as the intent behind its use. And remember, progress without ethics is just a faster route to disaster.
- Eleanor Vance"
