## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises shortcuts, not solutions. It amplifies existing flaws as easily as it does potential. Remember the human element, the problem it's trying to solve, and the unintended consequences before you blindly adopt the next 'innovation'. It's a tool, not a savior. Measure success by real improvement, not lines of code.

- Evelyn Reed"
