## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't wait for you to catch up.
Ignoring it is a choice, but not a smart one.
Every tool changes how we work, communicate, and even think.
Adapt, learn, and use it to improve, or become obsolete.
The future isn't coming; it's already here, changing things now.
- Evelyn Reed"
