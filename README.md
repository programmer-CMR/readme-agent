## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones.
Efficiency gains often mask underlying fragility.
Progress demands constant vigilance, not blind faith.
The latest tool is only useful if you understand its limits.
Always consider who benefits and who pays the price.
- Evelyn Reed"
