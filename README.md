## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad. It just amplifies what already exists.
Used poorly, it creates problems faster than we can solve them.
Used responsibly, it offers powerful tools for improvement.
The real challenge lies in deciding which path to take.
Focus on the human element, not just the gadget.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
