## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad.
It's a tool, and like any tool, it can build or destroy.
The difference lies entirely in the hands of the user.
Consider your purpose and your impact before unleashing it.
Remember, progress that benefits only a few, isn't progress at all.
- Ada Lovelace Turing"
