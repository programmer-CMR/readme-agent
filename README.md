## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's amplified action.
Think first, code later. A faster mistake is still a mistake.
New tools solve old problems and create new ones.
Understand the problem you're trying to solve before automating.
Progress isn’t just speed; it’s about making things better for everyone.

- Elias Thorne"
