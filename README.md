## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should serve, not enslave.
Increased efficiency doesn't justify mass layoffs.
Innovation without ethical considerations is just reckless experimentation.
Consider the consequences before deploying something irreversible.
The future isnâ€™t inherently better; we must build it responsibly.
- Eleanor Vance"
