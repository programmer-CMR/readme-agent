## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's just applied knowledge.

Faster doesn't always mean better, just faster. Think about the consequences.

Progress without purpose is just change. What problems are you solving?

Innovation needs oversight. Who benefits, and who gets left behind?

Don't let the latest gadget distract you from real human connection.

- Elias Thorne"
