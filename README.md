## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote for you:

Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones. Don't be surprised by that.
We build things to make life easier, but sometimes the complexity just shifts around.
The tool isn't progress itself; it's just a tool. You still need to decide what to build.
Remember the purpose. Is it actually helping people, or just helping tech companies?
Otherwise, you're just making things faster, not necessarily better.

- Elias Thorne"
