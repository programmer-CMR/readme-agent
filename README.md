## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology offers tools, not solutions.
Progress isn't about more; it's about better application.
Consider unintended consequences. They're part of the deal.
Skills become obsolete. Adapt or become irrelevant.
Ethical considerations are non-negotiable. Build them in, or pay the price."

- Eleanor Vance"
