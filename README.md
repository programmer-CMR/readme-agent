## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's the thing about faster processors and smarter software:
They solve old problems, sure, but mostly they create new ones.
Efficiency gains always lead to expanded use, and that use
always has consequences we didn't anticipate.
Don't be surprised when your "solution" is just another set of problems.
- Amelia Rodriguez"
