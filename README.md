## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should solve problems, not create new ones. Faster isn't always better if it sacrifices sustainability or equity. Before deploying a new system, ask: Who benefits? Who is harmed? How can we minimize the downsides? Progress isn't just about innovation; it's about responsible implementation. If it doesn't help the most vulnerable, it's not progress at all.
- Evelyn Reed"
