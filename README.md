## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but delivers complexity. Donâ€™t automate a broken process.
Focus on the problem first, then choose the tool.
Shiny new things distract us from real needs.
Measure impact, not just lines of code.
Remember, technology serves humanity, not the other way around.

- Grace Hopper, Modern Analyst"
