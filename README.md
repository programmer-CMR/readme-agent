## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology changes the game, sure. But remember: it's a tool.
It amplifies what's already there, good or bad.
Doesn't solve the core human problems by itself.
Garbage in, garbage out. Don't expect miracles from algorithms.
Focus on the *why* before you fixate on the *how.*

- Grace Hopper, Programming Pioneer"
