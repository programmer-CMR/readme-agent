> "Here's a quote:

Technology changes everything, yes, but it changes people faster.
Don't just chase the new shiny object.
Understand its effects, both good and bad.
Otherwise, you're just building a bigger problem with faster tools.
Control technology before it controls you.

- Alice Beaumont, Systems Analyst"
