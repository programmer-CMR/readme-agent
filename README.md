## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, not miracles.
Always ask: Does this *actually* improve lives, or just complicate them?
New tools require new skills and responsibilities. Don't ignore either.
Progress isn't just about what *can* be done, but what *should* be.
If it replaces human connection with screens, rethink its value.

- Evelyn Reed"
