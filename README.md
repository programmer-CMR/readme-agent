## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't neutral. It amplifies what already exists.
If your company is disorganized, new software won't fix it,
it'll just make the chaos faster. Focus on the basics first.
And remember, innovation without ethical considerations is just
a faster path to potentially bigger problems for everyone.
- Evelyn Reed"
