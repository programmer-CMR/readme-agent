## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises convenience, but demands constant vigilance. New tools solve old problems while creating new, more complex ones. Efficiency gains are temporary if training and maintenance are neglected. The "upgrade" cycle benefits the manufacturer more than the user. Practical application trumps theoretical potential every single time.
- Elias Vance"
