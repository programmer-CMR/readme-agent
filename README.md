## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't just about faster machines or smarter phones.
It's about solving real problems for real people.
Does this technology improve lives, or just create new distractions?
Look past the hype, focus on tangible benefits and ethical considerations.
Otherwise, we're just building expensive toys on unstable ground.
- Elias Vance"
