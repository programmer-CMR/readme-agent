## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad. It just amplifies what we already are.
If we build tools to connect, but use them to divide,
we haven't progressed. We've just become more efficient at self-destruction.
The real challenge isn't creating the next big thing,
but ensuring the big thing doesn't crush us all.

- Evelyn Reed"
