## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology advances because people need it to.

New tools solve old problems, but they also create new ones.

Don't let shiny things distract you from the real job.

Progress is not automatic; it demands constant effort and vigilance.

Use what works, fix what's broken, and don't be afraid to start over.

- Evelyn Reed"
