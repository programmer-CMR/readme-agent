## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool. It amplifies what already exists.
If you're using it to spread misinformation, it'll do that faster.
If you're using it to connect with loved ones, it can do that better.
Don't blame the hammer for the crooked house, blame the builder.
Focus on the intention, not just the invention."
- Amelia Davies"
