## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones, guaranteed.
Faster isn't always better if it breaks things faster too.
Progress shouldn't benefit only a select few or it's a failure.
Always ask who profits and who pays when things get "innovative."
Real advancement fixes real needs, not manufactured desires.

- Elias Thorne"
