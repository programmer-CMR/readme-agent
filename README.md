## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't neutral; it's a tool shaped by choices.
Faster doesn't equal better if we're rushing towards the wrong thing.
Progress should solve problems, not create new, bigger ones.
Always ask who benefits and who pays the price for any advancement.
Remember that humanityâ€™s core values are not upgradable.

- Eleanor Vance"
