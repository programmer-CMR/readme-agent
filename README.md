## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here's one idea:

Technology is a tool. Like any tool, it can build or destroy.
The faster it moves, the more important it is to know what you are doing.
Innovation without ethics is just reckless momentum.
Don't let shiny gadgets distract you from the human problems they are supposed to solve.
Focus on outcomes, not just the newest version number.

- Evelyn Reed"
