## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but demands constant adaptation.
The newest tool is only useful if it solves an actual problem, not just creating a new one.
Progress isn't just about faster and shinier; it's about better for everyone.
If we focus solely on innovation without considering the consequences, we are destined to be caught by them.
The greatest advancements are the ones that empower more people, not just the privileged few.

- Ada Lovelace IV"
