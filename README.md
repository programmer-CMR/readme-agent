## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's only good if it solves a real problem, and even then, only if the solution doesn't create ten more. Don't chase the shiny new thing just because it's shiny. Ask: Does this actually make life better, and for whom? If the answer is a fuzzy maybe, or just for the developers, walk away. We need tools, not toys.

- Eleanor Vance"
