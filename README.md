## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote in the style you requested:

"New tech solves problems, but it also creates new ones.
Don't be blinded by the shiny object.
Focus on the actual human impact.
Will this make lives genuinely better, or just easier to track?
If it only benefits a few, it's not really progress."
- Ada Lovelace"
