## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones just as fast. Don't assume it always means 'better.'

Every tool has a trade-off, and you need to understand both sides. Implementation is key.

Think about the human impact first, not the speed or efficiency. What are the consequences?

Focus on building lasting solutions, not just the latest gadgets. Consider long-term costs.

Remember, progress is about improving lives, not just generating data."
- Eleanor Vance"
