## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic. It's a tool.

Tools can build empires or destroy lives, depending on who's holding them and what they want.

Faster isn't always better. Think about what you're actually speeding toward.

Progress should solve real problems, not create new ones that only tech can fix.

If it makes the world more complicated for the average person, it's probably not progress.

- Evelyn Reed"
