## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances. It does what it does.
The question is not simply "can we," but "should we?"
Each new tool needs a matching new responsibility.
Otherwise, progress benefits some while harming others.
Don't let innovation outpace your own common sense.

- Amelia Hartford"
