## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's a tool.
If it makes things faster, that's good.
If it makes things easier to mess up, that's bad.
Always remember who's in control, you or the machine.
And always have a backup plan that doesn't require electricity.

- Brenda "Mac" McAlister, Systems Analyst"
