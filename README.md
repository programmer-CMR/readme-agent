## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool. Nothing more, nothing less.
Its value is directly tied to the problem it solves.
Progress isn't inevitable, it requires focused effort.
Don't be blinded by the new; ask what it actually *does*.
If it doesn't improve lives, it's just a distraction.

- Evelyn Hayes"
