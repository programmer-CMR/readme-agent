## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises shortcuts, but shortcuts often skip crucial steps. Understand the fundamentals before relying on algorithms. Data helps us see patterns, but it can also blind us to common sense. Progress isn't just about building faster; it's about building better for everyone involved, not just a select few. Use it wisely, or it will use you.
- Evelyn Reed"
