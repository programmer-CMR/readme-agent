## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers power, not wisdom.
Faster doesn't automatically mean better.
Progress requires conscious direction, not just forward motion.
Always consider the consequences, intended or otherwise.
Focus on improving lives, not just increasing capabilities."
- Eleanor Vance"
