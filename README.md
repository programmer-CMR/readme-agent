## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve human problems, it magnifies them. Bad intentions become widespread, fast. Good intentions are given a longer reach, sure, but are they loud enough? Progress requires responsibility built-in, not tacked on later. Ignoring that fact is a recipe for advanced disaster.
- Anya Sharma"
