## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Here's my offering:

"Technology isn't magic. It's a tool.
Like any tool, it can build something great or break something worse.
The faster things get, the more you need to think.
Don't let the new shine blind you to the consequences.
Otherwise, progress just means accelerating towards the cliff."
- Evelyn Reed, Systems Analyst"
