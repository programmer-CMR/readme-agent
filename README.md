## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology simplifies tasks, but it doesn't simplify life.
Faster processing just means more data to process.
Progress demands we adapt, or become obsolete.
Always question the source code and the motives behind it.
Remember the human; technology serves, it doesn't replace.
- Evelyn Reed"
