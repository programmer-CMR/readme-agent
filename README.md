## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology moves forward. It doesn't care if you're ready.
Learn it or be left behind. Adapt, evolve, or become irrelevant.
Complaining won't stop the next upgrade, only your future.
Don't get lost in the past, build something useful now.
The only constant is change. Embrace the current.

- Elias Thorne"
