## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but it rarely delivers pure freedom. It shifts the burdens, it doesn't erase them. Learning to adapt to the constant churn is more important than mastering any single tool. Understand that every solution creates new problems, and critical thinking is your best defense. Don't be seduced by the hype, measure its true impact.
- Elias Vance"
