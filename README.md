## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology simplifies tasks, but not necessarily life. Understand the difference.
Progress often promises ease, but it mostly redefines challenges.
Just because you *can* automate something, doesn't mean you *should*. Think about the second-order consequences.
Focus on using innovation to empower people, not replace them entirely.
Always ask: Does this new tool truly serve humanity, or just create new dependencies?

- Eleanor Vance"
