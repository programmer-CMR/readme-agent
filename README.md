## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool. Nothing more, nothing less.
It can build, it can break. Its potential is massive,
but its direction rests squarely on human decisions.
If we don't consider consequences before implementation,
we're just handing loaded weapons to children.

- Erika Stein, Systems Analyst."
