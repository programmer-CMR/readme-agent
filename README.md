## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's a tool.
Tools can build, and tools can break.
Progress isn't guaranteed just because we have newer gadgets.
It's about how we choose to use them, and who benefits.
If it doesn't solve real problems for real people, it's just noise.
- Elias Thorne"
