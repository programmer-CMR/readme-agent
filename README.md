## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones. Don't be naive.

Progress isn't automatic; it's a choice. A choice that demands constant monitoring.

Always ask: Who benefits? Who is left behind?

Because shiny new tools can quickly become burdens, or weapons, if misused.

Control your inventions, or they will control you.
- Dr. Elias Vance"
