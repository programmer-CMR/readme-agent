## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it's a tool, not a magic wand.
Don't let the shiny new thing distract you from basic needs.
Progress isn't just about speed, it's about direction.
Ask yourself if the latest gadget is making life better, or just different.
Be critical, not just consumers; control technology, don't let it control you.
- Elias Thorne"
