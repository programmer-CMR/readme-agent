## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad. It's a tool.
Think of it like a hammer; you can build a house with it,
or you can smash someone's skull. The important thing
is focusing on *who* controls that hammer, and *why* they're
swinging it. That determines its impact, not the hammer itself."
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
