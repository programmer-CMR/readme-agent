## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's purpose isn't just to automate.
It's about amplifying human potential, not replacing it.
If your innovation makes lives harder, rethink it.
Progress is measured by societal benefit, not just by profit margins.
Ultimately, tech is a tool. Use it wisely, or it uses you.
- Evelyn Reed"
