## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it creates new ones we didn't anticipate. Ignoring those new problems just makes the old ones look manageable. We need to budget for the cleanup, not just the upgrade. And "later" becomes "never" real quick. Progress isn't free, it's just debt we put on future generations.
- Amelia Hernandez"
