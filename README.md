## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote for you:

"Technology's only as good as the problem it solves.
If it doesnâ€™t make someoneâ€™s life easier or more efficient,
itâ€™s just a shiny distraction eating up resources.
Don't chase the newest gadget; chase the genuine need.
Remember: tools should serve, not enslave."

- Elias Thorne"
