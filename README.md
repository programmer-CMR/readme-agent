## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology offers solutions, but doesn't guarantee wisdom.
Every advance creates new vulnerabilities.
Focus on the problem first, the tool second.
Progress without ethical consideration is simply speed in the wrong direction.
Remember: tools amplify human nature, for good or ill.
- Eleanor Vance"
