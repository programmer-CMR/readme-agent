## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote:

Technology isn't inherently good or bad. It's a tool.
What matters is who controls that tool, and what their goals are.
Think about accessibility. Who benefits from this? Who's left out?
Innovation without ethics is just a faster way to make bigger problems.
Don't get so blinded by the 'new' that you forget to ask 'why'.

- Elias Thorne"
