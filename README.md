## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones.
The faster we go, the more likely we are to crash.
Progress isn't always forward; sometimes it's a sideways shuffle.
Just because you *can* do something doesn't mean you *should*.
Always ask who benefits most from the latest breakthrough.

- Evelyn Reed"
