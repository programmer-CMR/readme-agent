## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology offers solutions, not magic.
Every advance requires responsible application.
Ignoring potential downsides guarantees future problems.
Progress isn't automatic; it demands constant vigilance.
Build ethically, or rebuild expensively later.

- Elara Vance, Systems Engineer"
