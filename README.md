## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a destination.
Advancement happens when we solve real problems, not invent new ones.
Just because we can, doesn’t mean we should.
Focus on improving lives, not just increasing speed.
Measure progress by its impact on the many, not the benefit to the few.
- Eleanor Vance, Efficiency Consultant"
