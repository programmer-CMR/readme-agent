## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology gives us tools, not solutions. A faster hammer doesn't build a better house if the plans are flawed. Progress isn't just about doing things quicker. It's about understanding what's worth doing in the first place and ensuring the benefits reach everyone, not just a select few. Always question the purpose behind the innovation.
- Eleanor Vance"
