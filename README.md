## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's just tools.

Good tools should solve real problems, not invent new ones.

Progress means improving lives, not just making things faster.

If a new gadget makes you feel worse, or isolates you, unplug it.

Focus on what matters, not just what's shiny and new.
- Evelyn Reed"
