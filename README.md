> "Here's a quote in the requested style:

"Technology promises shortcuts, but shortcuts often require detours.
The bigger the advancement, the larger the potential for unforeseen problems.
Never assume a new system works perfectly right out of the box.
Always have a backup plan, and train people to use it.
Progress isn't about eliminating risk, it's about managing it better."
- Elias Vance"
