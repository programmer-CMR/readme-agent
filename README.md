## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is a tool, not a magic wand.

It amplifies what we already are, good or bad.

Implementing new tech without fixing broken processes

just makes those broken processes happen faster.

Think it through before you click 'install'."
- Margaret "Maggie" Callahan, Systems Analyst"
