## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances, but human nature doesn't. Build a faster hammer, people will still hit the wrong nail. Automation creates efficiency, but not necessarily equity. Progress isn't just about "can we?", but "should we?" and "for whom?". Remember, disconnected convenience breeds collective dependence.

- Eleanor Vance"
