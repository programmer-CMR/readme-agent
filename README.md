## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology moves, that's its nature.
Don't chase every shiny update; focus on what *works*.
Will it actually improve lives or just complicate them?
Think practical application, not theoretical potential.
And remember, progress isn't always forward motion.

- Elara Vance, Systems Efficiency Consultant"
