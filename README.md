## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but demands constant vigilance.
New tools solve old problems, while creating entirely new ones.
Progress isn't free; it requires resources and critical evaluation.
The future isn't predetermined, it is built by the choices we make now.
Ignoring unintended consequences is not innovation, it's negligence.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
