## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones. Don't get so caught up in the shiny object that you ignore the potential fallout. Progress isn't automatically good. It's a tool, and like any tool, it can be used to build or destroy. Before rushing forward, understand the consequences. Someone will pay the price, even if it isn't you.

- Janet Ramirez"
