## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but delivers complexity.
New tools solve old problems and create brand new ones.
Progress isn't about faster speeds, it's about better decisions.
Always ask, "What does this *really* change, and for whom?"
If a device needs constant updating, it's not liberation.

- Eleanor Vance"
