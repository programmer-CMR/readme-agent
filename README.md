## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't inherently solve problems, it just changes them.

Faster communication doesn't guarantee better understanding.

Data access doesn't equate to ethical action.

Progress without planning creates bigger messes, faster.

Always ask what a new tool *actually* improves, not just what it promises.

- Elara Vance, Systems Analyst"
