## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's promise is improvement, not replacement.
It's a tool, not a crutch.
Faster is only better if the outcome is better, too.
Before chasing the newest trend, solve the current problem.
Always ask: does this actually make life easier, or just more complicated?
- Anya Sharma, Operations Analyst"
