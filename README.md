## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promised efficiency, but it shifted the burden. We trade time saved on tasks for time spent managing the tech itself. Remember to ask if the "progress" truly simplifies your life, or just adds another layer of complexity. Obsession with the newest model blinds us to the real cost â€“ wasted potential, ignored relationships, and a constant state of upgrade anxiety. If it doesn't fundamentally improve your core values, leave it alone.
