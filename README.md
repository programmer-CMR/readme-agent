## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology offers solutions, not escapes. Don't mistake a better tool for a better understanding of yourself or the world.
Progress only matters if it betters lives, not just bank accounts.
Faster isn't always better if it means breaking what already works.
Always ask *who* benefits and *how* before celebrating any new thing.
Otherwise, you're just applauding your own obsolescence.

- Eleanor Vance"
