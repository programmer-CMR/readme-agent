## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic. It's a tool.
Tools can build or destroy, depending on who's holding them.
Progress doesn't guarantee improvement; it just changes the options.
Focus on what problems you are solving, not just what buttons you can push.
Remember that automation without ethics is just efficient recklessness.
- Ada Lovelace Ramirez"
