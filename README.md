## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad.
It's a tool, and tools amplify existing intentions.
If you're trying to connect people, it helps you connect them faster.
If you're trying to exploit people, it helps you exploit them on a larger scale.
Don't expect circuits to solve problems of the heart.

- Dr. Evelyn Reed"
