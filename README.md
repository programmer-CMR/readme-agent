## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology fixes problems and creates new ones.
Every step forward makes us blind to something behind.
Efficiency demands we question what is actually saved.
Don’t trust the hype, look at who truly benefits.
Progress is only progress if it lifts everyone up, not just a few.
- Anya Sharma"
