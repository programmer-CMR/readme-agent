## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology advances, but it doesn't solve everything.
It creates new problems even as it addresses old ones.
We must remember that tools are only as good as the hands
that wield them, and progress isn't guaranteed improvement.
Focus on outcomes, not just the shiny new gadget.
- Janet Kimble"
