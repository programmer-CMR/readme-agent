## 📅 Daily Quote

> "Technology changes things, plain and simple.
It makes some jobs obsolete, creates new ones.
Don't get caught up in the shiny distractions.
Focus on learning skills that computers can't easily copy.
Adapt or become a footnote in the next upgrade cycle.
- Robert Maxwell, Efficiency Consultant"
