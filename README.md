## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but rarely delivers it without demanding constant maintenance and upgrades. Understand that progress isn't a straight line; it's a messy, iterative process. Don't blindly trust any system marketed as "revolutionary." Test, verify, and adapt, always considering the human cost. What matters is not how fast you can do something, but whether it's actually worth doing at all. Remember, the best tools amplify, they don't replace, critical thinking.
